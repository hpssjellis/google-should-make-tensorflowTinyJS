Starting a new push, to lobby #google to make #tensorflowTinyJS to give client side, secure, internet free, #developer simplicity to #machineLearning at the #edge. An attempt to bring an easier tool to #tinyML,  #webDevelopers, #webAI, #webML, #makers and #engineers. Jason Mayes 

I have a proof of concept merging #webSerial with #tensorflowJS, but #google has the power to stabilize #webUSB on all devices and simplify the #tensorflow_converter for the web.

The #rightToRepair the millions of low cost, low power #ml capable #microcontrollers, in a simple way but I feel that I am a lone voice in this journey.

I think web developers, #education and makers have the most to gain from this secure, powerful, growth area.

Are you going to the #bayArea Maker fair this October, 2024 for the Saturday or Sunday?  https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/   Why not include the Google #webAiSummit on the Friday? https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/web-ai-summit-2024



I am trying to get Google to look into making #tensorflowTinyJS which would merge #TensorflowJS with #maker #ML #microcontrollers using #webSerial. I have a proof of concept, do you have an Arduino  #nano33BleSense?

If interested then comment or just show up at the summit.

Are you a #webDeveloper in the #bayArea?  Then come to the #webAI, #WebML event on Oct 18, 2024.

https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/web-ai-summit-2024

I am coming from #Canada, not presenting, but if you are going and already know WebAI, #webML, are an Arduino #maker, or #microcontroller #engineer, and curious about #webSerial and #tinyML in the #browser then talk to me at the event.

Starting a new push, to lobby #google to make #tensorflowTinyJS to give client side, secure, internet free, #developer simplicity to #machineLearning at the #edge. An attempt to bring an easier tool to #tinyML,  #webDevelopers, #webAI, #webML, #makers and #engineers. Jason Mayes 

I have a proof of concept merging #webSerial with #tensorflowJS, but #google has the power to stabilize #webUSB on all devices and simplify the #tensorflow_converter for the web.

The #rightToRepair the millions of low cost, low power #ml capable #microcontrollers, in a simple way but I feel that I am a lone voice in this journey.

I think web developers, #education and makers have the most to gain from this secure, powerful, growth area.
